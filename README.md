Coursera-ML-Py
==============

Repository for "Machine Learning" by Andrew Ng on Coursera, solutions written with NumPy.

These are just made as an NumPy exercise.
I've written all the solutions in Octave/MATLAB previously but I'd like to get a little more comfortable with NumPy so thought this would be a good way to get used to it.
